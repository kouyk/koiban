# KOIban
A simple animated film index website built using data scraped from douban, made for the 3rd project of THU CS Y1 summer programming module.

A version of the site is available as preview [here](https://koiban.stevenkou.xyz)

## KOIBan?!
KOIBan is just a wordplay with douban (豆瓣), the original site in which data was collected from. The first character in the chinese name of douban becomes "KOI" when one looks at it sideways, so naturally a site ripping it off will try to maintain the same name. Hence KOIBan. (Disclaimer: I'm not that creative, the idea isn't new, in fact it is copied from the popular bubble tea chain store KOI.)
